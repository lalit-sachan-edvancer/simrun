# simrun

Should be addressing following data simualtion scenarios 

1. simulation of independent columns containing numbers , categorical values , id , dates 
2. simulation of independent columns with probability constraints on values
3. simulation from distributions 
4. simulation of columns which are roughly dependent on one other column : nested pairs 
5. simulation of columns which can follow a rough probabilistic decision tree model involving multiple columns and rules 
   1. challenge here will be to figure out what data structure will be used to pass that rule tree 
   2. Then we can do probabilistic generation of values in the buckets 
6. The above can be used for generating targets as well as multilevel dependence between the features 
7. We would need functionality for introducing data dirt [missing values etc ]
